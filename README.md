# Synchronous Code Review Exercises

## Review Process

Each of these reviews take place in the context of a
roleplaying scenario to mimick scenarios where the
student may be assessed synchronously by a client. The
client is played the reviewer and the reviewer simply
observes as they take notes on the student's approach.

The client is assumed to be semi-technical. They can
understand some programming terms, but they are
mostly interested in the delivery of value. The student
should thus not aim to impress from a
technical standpoint and seek the simplest approach.

Once the review session begins, the reviewer recites
a prompt associated with the exercise. The student is then
invited to ask any questions to gain clarity. The reviewer
deliberately does not give up all the information regarding
the exercise. This drives the student to think more about
the problem being presented.

Once the student feels they are ready to start working on 
the problem, they may proceed. Due to the client being
non-technical, the student needs to explain what they
are doing to the reviewer in non-technical terms.

The reviewer switches from the roleplaying when there are 5 
minutes remaining in the review. They discuss the student's
attempt at the problem and the process they followed and how
it could be improved. The student receives a code review
aimed at improving their process and directing practice.

The student is encouraged to book another code review at least 
two weeks from their last one to give sufficient time to
address the issues raised in the code review. The feedback
provided by the reviewer notes whether there are improvements
from the last time the student was reviewed. Each synchronous
code review comes with a new exercise.
